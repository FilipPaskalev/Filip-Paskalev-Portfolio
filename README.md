## Project tasks

### Acceptance Criteria and requirements

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

- When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you.
- When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.
- When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications.
- When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others.
- When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application.
- When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport.

### Mock-up

The following animation shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
